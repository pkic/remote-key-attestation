* [X.509-based Attestation Evidence](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-rats-pkix-key-attestation/)

* [WebAuthn Defined Attestation Statement Formats](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#sctn-defined-attestation-formats)

* [ACME Device Attestation Extension](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-acme-device-attest/04/)

Other suggestions, which hasn't been seen live in any of the above implementations:

* [SKAE extension (Trusted Computing Group)](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/IWG_SKAE_Extension_1-00.pdf)

* [Remote ATtestation ProcedureS (rats)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rats/about/)

There is also a draft with [Use cases for Remote Attestation common encodings](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-richardson-rats-usecases-08). Section 7 describes several of the encodings listed in the table above.
